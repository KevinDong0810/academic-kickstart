I am currently a second-year M.A.Sc student at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS), co-supervised by Prof Angela Schoellig at the Dynamics System Lab, and Prof Florian Shkurti at the Department of Computer Science in U of T. Before joining UTIAS, I finished my undergraduate study at Beihang University. I am passionate about the intersection of machine learning, deep reinforcement learning, and robotics technologies.  If you have any interesting ideas in these fields, please feel free to contact me.
